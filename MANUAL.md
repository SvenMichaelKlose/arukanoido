ARUKANOIDO â€“ Manual
===================

# Original arcade sounds

ARUKANOIDO provides original arcade sound but this comes at the
cost of CPU time and thus fluency of graphics display which one
might find too distracting to get fun out of it.
There are four modes you can select by pressing the 'M' key in
the title screen:

* VIC chip sounds only,
* original audio for the off-game tunes only,
* original in-game sounds, except the laser sound and,
* all tunes and in-game sounds.

# Playing strategies

In general it's a good idea to clear off as many bottom bricks
as you can before the ball hits the roof because that's when it
accelerates a lot in most levels, requiring impressive reaction
times to cope with the high speeds of the ball.  It is also a
good idea to keep the ball's trajectory shallow by hitting it
with the sides of the Vaus.  Some levels will urge you to do it
the other way around though.  Keep in mind that the ball will
speed up the more it hit something anyhow, so you shouldn't
be wasting time either.  When time becomes a scarce resource,
laser and disruption mode might come in handy.  Remember that
hitting a lot of bricks will also give you extra lives.  The
disruption mode is especially useful if you the balls won't
reach the Vaus for some time.

## Level 1

This is the easiest level of them all.  The bricks are on top
of the screen, giving you enough time to acclimate to the
environment and to collect lifes to get a good start.  You
should avoid staying in the disruption mode with multiple balls
as it will prevent more bonuses from occuring.  Just take it to
get a 1000 points.  Laser mode will also reduce the number of
bonuses one can catch.
If you caught the break mode you should wait taking the exit
until only few blocks are left, so you are more likely to get a
higher score.  And higher scores mean more extra lifes.  Last
but not least you should clear the silver bricks last or the
ball will shoot down at high speed and the obstacles will get
in your way, making the ball less predictable.

## Level 2

Try to clear the row of silver bricks but not the red brick
to its right or it'll open the can of worms.  The laser is
your friend for making space at the bottom.  Hitting the roof
will spped up the ball to unpleasant levels and then you want
to take any chance to get out.

## Level 3

You have to release the ball with a shallow angle by moving
the Vaus and pressing fire at the same time, so it'll make
an opening to the right immediately.  Otherwise you'll find
yourself juggling with the ball in a way that might be not
very much to your liking.  When done right, the ball will
race upwards, making a visually rewarding impression.
HINT: Get the ball through the leftmost or rightmost brick at
the bottom to impress everyone by vanishing almost all bricks
in one go.

## Level 4

No matter if shallow or not, the ball will race up and down
the gaps, so avoid them until you made space at the bottom.
Hitting the roof will not speed things up in this level.
A widened Vaus is of great help.

## Level 5

This is where wimen are separated from the girls.  If you let
the ball off to the top, hell will break lose for almost no
bonuses, so you better get the bottom cleared as fast as you
possibly can.  Reaction times are of the essence.
