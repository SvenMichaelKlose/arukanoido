# Original arcade sounds

ARUKANOIDO provides original arcade sound but this comes at the
cost of CPU time and thus fluency of graphics display which one
might find too distracting to get fun out of it.
There are four modes you can select by pressing the 'M' key in
the title screen:

* VIC chip sounds only,
* original audio for the off-game tunes only,
* original in-game sounds, except the laser sound and,
* all tunes and in-game sounds.

# Playing strategies

In general it's a good idea to clear off as many bottom bricks
as you can before the ball hits the roof because that's when it
accelerates a lot in most levels, requiring impressive reaction
times to cope with the high speeds of the ball.  It is also a
good idea to keep the ball's trajectory shallow by hitting it
with the sides of the Vaus.  Some levels of course will urge
you to do it the other way around.  Keep in mind that the ball
will speed up anyway the more it reflects from something anyhow,
so you shouldn't be wasting time either.

## Level 1

This is the easiest level of them all.  The bricks are on top
of the screen, giving you enough time to acclimate to the
environment and to collect lifes to get a good start.  You
should avoid staying in the disruption mode with multiple balls
as it will prevent more bonuses from occuring.  Just take it to
get a 1000 points.  If you caught the break mode you should wait
taking the exit until only few blocks are left, so you are more
likely to get a higher score.  And higher scores mean more extra
lifes.
