This is an Arkanoid clone for the Commodore VIC–20 with at least 16K

automatically.

* No sound.
* No two-player mode.
* No intro or extra graphics.
* Round 3 is missing due to the ball's unfinished trajectory calculation.
* Round 33 is missing.
* No animated sprites.
* No distractions floating down.
* No B, C, E or S bonuses although they show.
