# Arukanoido

This is the demo of an Arkanoid clone for the Commodore VIC–20 with at
least 24K memory expansion.  It should be played with paddles which are
detected automatically as soon as you move them.

This demo contains only the first 8 rounds.

Arukanoido is being discussed and developed on the VIC–20 Denial forum:
